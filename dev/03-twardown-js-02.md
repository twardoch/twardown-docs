Below is an answer that addresses both parts of your question.

## 1. Using a Global Configuration with vscode-remark

By default, the vscode-remark extension looks for a remark configuration file inside your workspace
(for example, as a file named `.remarkrc`, `.remarkrc.yml`, or even in your project's package.json
under a "remarkConfig" key). There isn't (yet) a built‐in "global remark config" file that the
extension automatically looks up in your user folder (like
`~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json` on macOS).

However, you have a couple of options:

- **Make the Extension Always Run:**  
  The extension has a setting called `remark.requireConfig` (which defaults to `false`). If you set
  this to `true` in your user settings, then the extension will only run when – and only when – it
  finds a configuration file in the workspace. If you leave it as `false` (or don't set it), then it
  will run using its default behavior.  
  You could (if you wish) create a "global" config file in your HOME folder and, for every project,
  symlink it (or copy it) into the workspace.
- **Customize User Settings for VS Code:**  
  You might also add remark-related defaults directly into your VS Code User Settings for markdown
  formatting. See the extension's documentation for settings such as the default formatter. (For
  example, setting the formatter globally with the configuration below makes VS Code use
  vscode-remark for all Markdown files.)
  ```json
  {
    "[markdown]": {
      "editor.defaultFormatter": "unifiedjs.vscode-remark",
      "editor.formatOnSave": true
    }
  }
  ```

For now there is no "global remarkrc" facility that lives outside a workspace. Ultimately, if you'd
like a truly global configuration, you might consider opening a feature request on the
[vscode-remark GitHub repository](https://github.com/remarkjs/vscode-remark) or check whether the
language server (remark-language-server) provides fallback to a global installation (see related
issues on GitHub).

## 2. An Annotated and Exquisite `.remarkrc.yml`

Below is an example of a well-organized, annotated `remarkrc.yml` file. You can save it in your
project root (or in any supported configuration file name) so that vscode-remark (and remark-cli)
will pick it up.

```yaml
# =============================================================================
# Remark Configuration File
# =============================================================================
# This configuration file tells remark how to process markdown files.
# It enables a set of plugins for linting, formatting, and various markdown
# syntaxes. You can adjust each plugin's options as needed.
#
# Save this file as:
#   .remarkrc.yml
# in your project's root. There is currently no built-in way to specify a
# global configuration file outside of a workspace.
# =============================================================================

# Enable output; when set to true, remark will produce output after processing.

### Explanation of the YAML Structure

- **Top-Level Options:**  
  The `output` key enables or disables producing output from the processing run.

- **Plugins Section:**  
  Under `plugins`, each plugin is listed (using either a mapping with options or an empty object
  `{}` if no options are needed). Comments explain what each plugin does so you can later adjust its
  options if necessary.

- **Settings Section:**  
  These control how remark parses and formats markdown. For instance, you can specify how lists are
  indented, what style of headings to use, and whether to apply GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM).

Feel free to add, remove, or tweak plugins and settings based on the particular standards you want
your project to follow. This annotated file is an excellent starting point when using the
vscode-remark extension to lint and format your markdown files.

With these details, you should be able to both understand how (and where) to use a configuration for
vscode-remark and have a beautifully annotated sample configuration to customize your markdown
processing.

Below is our analysis and answer:

---

### Global Configuration in VS Code for vscode-remark

The vscode-remark extension (which powers remark-language-server) is designed to pick up a
configuration file from your workspace (or a parent folder) such as a `.remarkrc`, `.remarkrc.yml`,
or even a `remarkConfig` field in your project's package.json. It does not support defining a full
remark configuration directly in VS Code's global settings (e.g. in your user-level settings.json
located at `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json`). You can only control one global
flag – for example, the setting `"remark.requireConfig"` tells the extension whether to run only
when it finds a config file—but the detailed configuration must reside in a dedicated configuration
file in your project.  

---

### An Exquisite, Annotated `.remarkrc.yml` Configuration File

Below is a carefully organized and annotated YAML configuration file for remark. You can place this
file in your workspace (or a parent folder) so that the vscode-remark extension picks it up
automatically. Adjust repository names and any options as needed for your project.

```yaml
# .remarkrc.yml
# ============================================
# This file configures remark for linting and formatting Markdown.
# It is used both by remark-cli and the VSCode extension vscode-remark.
# Place this file in your project root so that it is automatically detected.
# ============================================

# Enable output formatting so that remark writes the transformed Markdown.
output: true

# --------------------------------------------
# Plugins Section: List all remark plugins to apply.
# --------------------------------------------
plugins:
  # Parse YAML frontmatter at the start of markdown files.
  - frontmatter

  # GitHub plugin:
  # Automatically transforms references (issues, commits, user mentions) into links.
  - github:
      # Set your repository (change this to match your repository if needed).
      repository: 'yourusername/yourrepo'
      # Disable strong mention if you prefer plain mentions.
      mentionStrong: false

  # Validate links:
  # Checks that all URLs and relative links are valid.
  - validate-links:
      # Optional: set repository for resolving relative links.
      repository: 'yourusername/yourrepo'

  # Heading gap:
  # Adjust spacing before and after headings to enforce a consistent style.
  - heading-gap:
      '1': # For level-1 headings:
        before: "\n\n" # Two newlines before the heading.
        after: "\n" # One newline after the heading.
      '2': # For level-2 headings:
        before: "\n" # One newline before.
        after: "\n" # One newline after.

  # Inline links:
  # Converts reference-style link definitions into inline links.
  - inline-links

  # Slug:
  # Generates URL-friendly slugs from headings (useful for linking).
  - slug

  # Squeeze paragraphs:
  # Removes redundant blank lines from paragraphs.
  - squeeze-paragraphs

  # YAML config:
  # Allows remark to load configuration from YAML files.
  - yaml-config

  # Autolink headings:
  # Automatically adds clickable anchor links to headings.
  - autolink-headings

  # Embed images:
  # Converts local image references into base64-encoded data URIs.
  - embed-images

  # External links:
  # Processes external links so that they open in a new browser tab.
  - external-links:
      target: '_blank' # Sets the target attribute to "_blank".

  # Gemoji:
  # Transforms GitHub emoji shortcodes (e.g. :smile:) into Unicode emoji.
  - gemoji

  # HTML:
  # Serializes the Markdown content as HTML if needed.
  - html

  # Parse YAML:
  # Processes YAML content in markdown (such as frontmatter) and exposes it.
  - parse-yaml

  # Table of Contents:
  # Automatically generates a TOC based on the headings in the document.
  - toc

  # Lint:
  # Runs remark-lint to check Markdown for style and syntax issues.
  - lint

  # Additional lint rule overrides:
  - lint-alphabetize-lists: false # Do not enforce alphabetization of list items.
  - lint-heading-increment: true # Ensure headings increment by only one level at a time.
  - lint-no-consecutive-blank-lines: true # Disallow multiple blank lines in a row.

# --------------------------------------------
# Settings Section: Controls output formatting.
# These options affect how remark-stringify converts the Markdown AST back to text.
# --------------------------------------------
settings:
  bullet: '*' # Use asterisk (*) for unordered list bullets.
  fence: '`' # Use backticks for fenced code blocks.
  strong: '**' # Use double asterisks for bold text.
  emphasis: '_' # Use underscores for italic text.
  closeAtx: false # Do not append closing '#' characters to ATX headings.
  gfm: true # Enable GitHub Flavored Markdown features.

  rule: '-' # Use a hyphen for thematic breaks.
  ruleRepetition: 3 # Repeat the rule character three times for a horizontal rule.

# ============================================
# End of configuration.
# ============================================
```

### Summary

• **Global Config:** Unfortunately, you cannot define a full remark configuration in VS Code's
global settings.json. Instead, vscode-remark requires a dedicated configuration file (like the one
above) placed in your workspace.  
• **.remarkrc.yml:** The sample YAML above is fully commented and organized so that you can adjust
it to your needs.

This configuration file works seamlessly with the vscode-remark extension (which uses the same
configuration files as remark-cli) and helps you enforce a consistent Markdown style across your
project.
